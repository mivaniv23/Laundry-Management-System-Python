Hereâ€™s the full README file with all the information in one place:

## Overview
This is a simple Python-based Laundry Management System that allows users to manage customers' laundry check-out, update charges, and view customer information. The system includes features like setting tax rates, charge rates, checking out customers, and saving customer data to CSV files.

### Features
- **Main Menu**: Choose between check-out, update charges, or view customers.
- **Check-Out**: Allows you to process a customer's laundry, calculate totals, and generate receipts.
- **Update Charges**: Change tax rates and charge per pound.
- **Customer Lists**: View customer information.
- **PDF Receipt Generation**: After check-out, generate a receipt for the customer in PDF format.
- **Data Persistence**: Customer information, receipts, and rates are saved to CSV files.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- `csv` for data storage
- `re` for regular expressions (for phone number validation)
- `fpdf` for generating PDF receipts

## Files
1. `main.py`: Main script that runs the menu system and interacts with the user.
2. `customer_info.csv`: Stores customer information (ID, last name, phone number, and annual total).
3. `tax.csv`: Stores the current tax rate.
4. `charge.csv`: Stores the cost per pound for laundry.
5. `receipt_number.csv`: Stores the receipt number for tracking.
6. `fpdf` library: Used for generating PDF receipts.
